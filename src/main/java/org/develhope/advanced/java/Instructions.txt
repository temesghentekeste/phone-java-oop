2- Create Interface and implement it via abstract class

-> Create Phone Interface, it should have call, text, showCallHistory and showTextHistory functions.
-> Create SimplePhone abstract classes and implement those functions. When you use call function it should ask who you want to call then should store it, if you text it should ask your text message and who you text with.

-> Create YourNamePhone(HuseyinPhone) and inherit the SimplePhone and test your codes.
